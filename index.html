            <div class="section-content">
                <p>The Digital Memory Project is an innovative research initiative dedicated to understanding how digital platforms shape our memories.</p>
                
                <h3>Research Goals</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Investigate the role of digital technologies in memory preservation and dissemination</li>
                    <li>Analyze how individuals curate and present their digital identities</li>
                    <li>Explore the intersection of collective memory and social media narratives</li>
                    <li>Exploring reasons of why people post personal memories online</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Project Scope</h3>
                <p>Our research encompasses multiple dimensions of digital memory, including personal memories online and offline spaces. We employ both qualitative and quantitative methodologies to provide comprehensive insights into how digital spaces function as memory vessels in the 21st century.</p>

                        <p class="bio">Dr. Divya Bhatia is an associate professor at Jindal School of Psychology and Counselling (JSPC), O.P. Jindal Global University. During her PhD at Sapienza University, Rome, Italy her work focused on the cognitive processes through which self and other’s performed actions come to influence one’s memory. At JSPC and JGU, she extends her research to understanding cognition in the digital world, and focuses on questions such as how do interactive digital contexts (e.g., social media, multitasking platforms, AI interfaces) alter the way we encode, remember, process information and relate to others? 

As Digital Memory Research Team, we are focused on understanding how human cognition, particularly memory, is being reconfigured in the digital age by the use of the Internet, social media and AI tools.
